I mentioned once that I wrote my first program on assembler when was eight years old. It was a simple which displays Fibonacci numbers sequentially. I had the only issue: I did not have access to a personal computer - only old calculator produced in USSR. In a primary school, we had only old workstations (also manufactured before I came to school). Nevertheless, I was happy because qBasic seemed to be interested than assembler. (Here I had access to display at least :) ) 
Despite that, I read many books about logic, a theory of probability and math. I honestly was fond of it. Again I did not have own PC at home. I could only write programs on papers and try at school several times for a week. However, **_right understanding the task and planning own work forward_** skills served me well for a long time.
After successfully passed exams I was able to choice any specialization in university. However, I made **_one of the most mistakes in mine life: I did not believe in myself much_**. I thought that I could not conquer other students who got surely better programming background from high school. When I'd realized it, I started study parallelly on the faculty of computers networks and systems. That allowed me successfully defend Masterwork in Electrical and get specialization "Computerization of power stations" and employed to a govern energy company.
During four years we built computer network and developed several projects (software for the internal usage). On this long lifetime experience moment, I understood how important is the choice of correct goals. That defines your way to the destination which sometimes is unseen, but the right answers to the correctly set question are the best hints to choose the appropriate direction. 
I worked in various outsourcing companies and done plenty projects apart, I was part several teams and worked with people from different cultures. Moreover, at this moment, I can advise you next: **_never allow another people make a valuation of your you or your job_**. Allow to make critics instead of judges. Stay passionate software developers instead of an employee which commonly is treated as 'working unit'. 
##### Smart people know how to overcome issues in life, but only wise people learned from mistakes made by other.
Stay the best as you are and as you can be!
